# Light-and-Vision-Demo

This project demonstrates light and vision capabilities in a 2D world.

# Build requirements

To successfully build the application, fxgraphics2d-1.10.jar needs to be added to the library of the project. The jar is located in the /lib folder.
Because of the usage of JavaFX, Java 1.8 must be set as the SDK.
